<p> A bundle of organic beets from a local farm food co-op program.</p>
<p>55 to 65 days are needed from germination to harvest of the root.</p>
<p>The usually deep purple roots of beetroot are eaten either grilled, boiled, or roasted as a cooked vegetable, cold as a salad after cooking and adding oil and vinegar, or raw and shredded, either alone or combined with any salad vegetable.</p>
<p> In fact, Jim Halpert once said this about beets, "Fact, bears eat beets. Bears, beets, Battlestar Galactica".</p>
<p> I have some weird habits. For instance, I love beets. Show me a salad bar and I will clean them out of their beets.</p>
